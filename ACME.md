# Main Differences to ACME

The program is no acme replacement. It shares some ideas.
The main differences are:
- Frontend: html+javascript (CodeMirror for the editor)
- Backend: go http server
- Mouse language is different, 2 buttons + scroll wheel
- Instead of a plumber, a command rule table is included in the front-end javascript code. This is ugly.
- It work's without the top header bar
